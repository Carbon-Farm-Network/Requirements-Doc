# Planning - Take into account Inventory

In 2025 CFN will have some inventory from 2024 (clean white wool).  The plan-from-recipe and all subsequent "automatic" planning, like the supply-driven re-planning, will need to take into account existing inventory (resources that are part of the production plan with >0 quantity).

## Logic backwards



## Logic forwards



## UI

I think the inventory should show up in the column before it is needed, which would be an output column. It can be below the gray stage backgrounds, like the existing transfer in commitments we have now. Let's use a different shape, a rectangle is good.  It should be green, since it is already there.  Fields: resource specification name, quantity/unit.

I think we should change the transfer-in commitments to the output columns before use also (the + icon and the shape).

# Add create, update to Economic Events page

The page currently lists all events, sorted descending.  Next step, allow edit to certain fields on existing events.  Also allow adding new events, which will be used for events that can't be added on the planning page.  (Events cannot be deleted.)

## Edit event

Put an edit icon (like the one on commitments on the planning page) on the right of each economic event.  It brings up a modal.  Fields that can be edited: description (note), tracking identifier.  (Will ask about the best way to name that on the UI.)

## Correct event

Put an icon (find one?) .... or do this in edit and if qty is changed, do a - and a + ????

## Add event

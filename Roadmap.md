# Roadmap Summer/2024

As of May 22, we are later than we hoped, which is not unexpected for a project such as this.  So now we need to re-juggle our (sometimes competing) priorities:
* Catch up with the CFN 2024 season so that the app gets the iterative feedback from real situations that it needs, then
* Keep up with the 2024 season, which can't stop and wait for the app, again critical for getting real feedback
* Make a demo we can use for more fundraising that showcases enough features that people can understand the potential
* Make the app completely configurable and usable enough for other networks to at least try it out, starting with Fibershed networks (when?)
* Catch hREA up with VF, so it doesn't become hopelessly behind as other projects use it, then catch CFN up with hREA (not only a CFN responsibility, but I do think of user groups supporting upgrade of underlying infrastructure as they develop their apps)

CFN schedule:
* Pickup fiber June 2-5
* Scouring
* Spinning
* ???

High level features to prioritize:
* Finish initial planning (recipes, bug fixes, UX upgrades for more computer assistance)
* Recording the production economic events (bug fixes, add resource creation/update, simple reporting of events and resources)
* Recording other economic events (donations/fees, payments to suppliers/others, inventory events and reporting, upgrade overview page for continuous monitoring and planning ("budge page"))
* Re-planning and coordinating during the season (supply-forward planning, maybe some demand upgrades, ?)
* Finish network configuration (units, recipes, map, images, ?)
*

# General Network Configuration

This list will grow throughout the project.  But I think it makes sense to have one page for this.  The details may change as we code the pages that need this.

For the upper left in the UI:

* Which agent is the network (or use role?)
* Network logo (upload)
* Network name (if not in the logo)

Map:

* center
* how big, whatever that is
* anything else is standard

Agent roles:

* If this can become part of an agent model / zome, that would be great.
* If not, we can create roles for agents assumed related to the network like we have now
* Roles need a name and a picture for the map (at least)

For all exchange based UI:

* Are all exchanges currency priced based? (yes/no)
* If so, what is the currency? (dropdown of the resource specifications that are currency - facet? hard-coded classification?

(Or, maybe for the currency question, we have a hard-coded choice for all resource specifications: offers only, requests only, both?  That wouldn't give the user as fine-grained dropdown lists as we could get with facets, but it is relatively simple.)

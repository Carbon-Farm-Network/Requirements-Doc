# General UI/UX decisions

Discussion needed.  Brainstorming:

Starting with the map, which will be the default page.  Display all nodes which have a location.

When something is clicked on the map, where does the info appear?  A pane on the right?  A popup?  Both (just a brief rollover on the map)?  

Should there be a "permanent" pane on the right?  Starting maybe with a list of agents by role?

Or something even more dashboardy?

Then, for other features (right now just configuration), what would be the preferred setup?  Tabs for sections?  More tabs vs less and sub-choices?  Hamburger menu? Note there will be a lot of features eventually.

# Requests

This is like Offers, with a few differences.  But the data structure used is the same (Proposal, ProposedIntent, Intent).

Here is the offers screen:

Here are changes needed for requests:
* Instead of provider, put receiver (also an agent in the primary Intent)
* What is requested from the network:  (change the text only)
* Instead of all those quantities, put only the resourceQuantity, consisting of text "Quantity" and "Unit"
* Skip the date available
* There is no reciprocal Intent needed for requests (for CFN)

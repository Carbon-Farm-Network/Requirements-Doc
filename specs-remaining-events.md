# Remaining features for season in process

## Event fulfilling multiple commitments

This came up around payments for multiple fiber resource specs on pick up.  It will also solve current awkwardness with the services. This is a fairly normal feature, basically line items on an invoice.  This integrates the exchanges better with the production plan.

### Choose commitments

The chosen commitments should all have the same provider and receiver.

### Modal for the payment

This can be like the modal for adding an event to an individual reciprocal commitment.  Before displaying, it should add up the quantities of the reciprocal commitments chosen into the quantity of the event.  If easy enough, we can also display something on the modal showing the individual commitments chosen, like $245 White Alpaca Dirty, $777 Gray Alpaca Dirty, probably should be multiple lines. (That is optional, given the time, but it would be helpful for the user.)  If we do create a new modal, also change "Commitment finished" to "Commitments finished".

### Save

Save the one event, fulfilling all of the chosen commitments.  If finished is chosen, update the finished flag on all of the chosen commitments and change the color on all to green.  If finished is not chosen, change color of all to yellow.
If we are now showing number of events on the reciprocal commitments (can't remember), then show one event on each of the commitments fulfilled. (If that is some work, let's skip for now.)

# Supply-driven Calculations

This option will give the ability in a Plan to recalculage the commitments forward.  Suggest we do it one column (inputs or outputs) at a time, adding a button or icon up top on each column.  Could be inside the gray box or outside.

Logic: 
```
For each Commitment in the column
  If the Commitment is not finished, use that quantity
  Else add up the Economic Event quantities, and use that
  
```

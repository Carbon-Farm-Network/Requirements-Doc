Pieces of code:

* CRUD recipes
* Plan from recipe (creates a plan, or a scenario)
* Planning page initial display (offers, requests, plan columns)
* Calculate supply-driven quantities, display on page
* Calculate demand-driven quantities, display on page
* User can play with the numbers, create/edit commitment quantities separately from the calculated ones (is this a Scenario or a Plan? should we show payments/costs?)
* Lock in plan (create actual commitments, is this one at a time, or the whole thing, or both?  include payment commitment)
* Notify suppliers of orders (send to them by email?)

Then, after the plan is done:

* Enter actual economic events against the commitments
*

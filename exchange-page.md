# Exchange page

## Add event

Icon or link to add an event to fulfill a commitment, like on Plan page. It could bring up the same modal.  And save it in the same way, fulfilling the commitment.  Allow to finish the commitment on that modal too.

Question for Leo: I can't remember why only one of the agents is available for changing for the event.  I'm not sure of the right answer, open up both, or leave both closed, or one (if there is a good reason for that one).  I tend towards leaving both open (but defaulted as now), for whatever odd situations might arise.  But let's chat, I might be missing something.

Question for users: Do we need the same "fulfill more than one commitment" feature that we just added to the Planning page?

Note: Events can be edited or corrected on the event list (Activity).

## New information on report

Add 2 new columns to the existing report:
* Events (displays the total quantity of the events)
* Finished (checkbox that is editable on the report page, updates the `finished` boolean on the commitment)

Split the report into two sections, Unfinished and Finished, with Unfinished at the top.  An agreement is finished if both commitments are marked finished.

TBD: Do we need a year filter like the cash flow?  (If so, we won't need it until next season.)  And/or any other filters, like agent perhaps, to more easily find an agreement to add to?

## Network formation

As a designer, I can join the purchasing cooperative, so that I can participate in coordination (?) benefits of the network.

As a non-designer role (farmer, mill, ?, transporter?), I can join the broader network as a supplier (?), so I can offer my goods and services preferentially in the network.

As a purchasing cooperative member, I must pay some up front costs each year, so that early operations can proceed. (one time fee?)

As a farmer (others?), I can get (USDA) and display "climate beneficial" certifications, so that designers can choose my goods and services with knowledge that their final products will be more sustainable and can be documented as such.

As a person interested in sustainable regional textiles, I can donate money or other resources, so that the network is more resilient.

As a network administrator (?), I can configure the types of membership, types of resources (materials details, service capabilities, etc.), so that the network has standard ways to communicate organizational responsibilitles and resource needs.

## Yearly planning

As a network member, I can estimate what I would like to contribute or produce in the network, so that together we can do some high level planning.

As a designer, I can commit to purchases of inputs to my final product(s), and provide partial payment, so that there is more stability in the network. ???

## Operations and coordination

As a member, I can provide my current and known future offers in detail (what I intend to supply or my leftover inventory), including minimum quantities and price points, so they are visible for coordinating and purchasing in the network.

As a designer member, I can plan my production, including quantities and resource details needed for the incoming flows and steps (requests), so that others can  use this to coordinate combining resources and production planning.

As a designer member, I can use software assistance to calculate losses in each step, so that it is easier to create plans. (????)

As a member, I can make changes to my offers, requests, plans mid-season as needed, so that changes can be accommodated in the network.

As a member I can invoice for what I provided, and record payment for what I received (in USD currently, possibly through check, VenMo, PayPal, credit card).  (We don't anticipate being able to tie into these electronic services directly yet.) 

(Connor: perhaps something like this below? )

As a member, I can schedule transportation services, and coordinate with others to combine, .... ??

As a member, I can easily see the current status of planning and doing at each step, so that I can better coordinate with others during the season.

As a member, I can receive notifications when something happens that could affect me, so that I don't have to pay constant attention.  This could include....

## Accounting

As a member, I can report or export my activity, so that I can do required accounting reports and/or tax reports.

As the network (or just the purchasing coop?), I can report or export the network activity, so that we can do required accounting reports and/or tax reports.
